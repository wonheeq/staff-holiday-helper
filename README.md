A year long student Capstone project for Curtin University created using PHP/Laravel, VueJS, MySQL and MJML.

Created by Won Hee Qin, Ellis Janson Ferrall, Aden Moore and Benjamin Han He Lee.

Please note the following:
- This was mostly our first time using each of our chosen frameworks and programming languages, and our first time creating a fully fleshed out web application
- Ideally we would have had 5 or 6 team members instead of 4


The program allows users to:
- Book leave
- Nominate another member of staff to cover responsibilities
- Accept or reject nominations by other staff members
- Manage existing bookings
- Have bookings accepted/rejected by Line Managers
- Administrators to create and manage accounts
- Notify staff members of leave booking status through email
- Notify staff members of nominations through email
- Notify line managers of leave bookings through email
- Accept/reject nominations through email
- Line managers to accept/reject leave applications through email
- View their current line manager
- View their current responsibilities
